# About

Got lots of OSM buildings with address data stored in a separate node instead of the the building itself?

Use this AutoHotKey script to quickly merge the objects into buildings with address data in JOSM.

# Configuration

In order for this thing to work, you must change the coordinates of one click. Choose coordinates so that they point somewhere in the area where tags are listed.
